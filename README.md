## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Node.js and npm**: Next.js is built on top of Node.js. If you don't have Node.js and npm installed, you can download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the project's repository to your local machine. You can use the following command, replacing `<repository_url>` with the actual URL:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the root folder of the project:

   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use npm to install the project's required dependencies. Run the following command within your project directory:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

Once you've set up the project and installed its dependencies, you can run the Next.js application. Typically, the entry point for a Next.js application is the `pages/index.js` file.

1. **Start the Development Server**: To launch the development server and run the application, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start the development server, and you should see an output indicating that the server is running.

2. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). This is the default address where the Next.js application for selling cars is served. If the entry point for your application is different from `pages/index.js`, be sure to visit the relevant route or page.

## Exploring the Application

The Next.js application for selling cars consists of various components, including `Hero`, `Navbar`, `Footer`, and `CustomButton`. These components contribute to building different sections of the web pages, allowing users to explore and purchase vehicles. Feel free to customize and modify these components to suit your specific project needs.

Please note that this README serves as a general guide for running a Next.js application designed for selling cars. Depending on the specific structure and requirements of your project, you may need to adjust these instructions accordingly.

## Additional Assistance

If you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the functionality of the application, we recommend referring to the project's documentation or seeking assistance from the project's maintainers or contributors.
